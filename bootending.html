        <h2>The boy stays still before looking to his right and seeing a boot in the water. He grabs the boot and inspects it. He sees there are teeth marks on the boot, before looking on the inside of the boot and seeing his Grandfather's initials. He realizes that the dog must've carried it out there, and runs back to the house with excitement! He cannot wait to show his family.</h2>
